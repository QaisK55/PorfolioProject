<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I’m a data analyst with a passion for turning raw data into meaningful insights.
  Currently, I’m expanding my technical skill set by learning to become a Full-Stack developer, with plans to dive deeper into Python
  next. I enjoy working with data to solve complex problems, optimize processes, and uncover trends that drive decision-making.
  As I continue to grow, I’m focused on sharpening my analytical skills, improving my technical expertise, and staying up-to-date with the latest tools 
  and technologies in data analysis. I'm always eager to learn and excited about the endless possibilities that data and technology offer!
